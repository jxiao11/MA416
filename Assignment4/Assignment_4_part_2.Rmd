```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library("tidyverse")

who <- tidyr::who
who1 <- who %>% 
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = TRUE)
who1 %>% 
  count(key)
who2 <- who1 %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))
who3 <- who2 %>% 
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
who3 %>% 
  count(new)
who4 <- who3 %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3)
who5 <- who4 %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who %>%
  gather(code, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(code = stringr::str_replace(code, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>%
  separate(code, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
```
###1. In this case study I set na.rm = TRUE just to make it easier to check that we had the correct values. Is this reasonable? Think about how missing values are represented in this dataset. Are there implicit missing values? Whatâ€™s the difference between an NA and zero?

```{r}
who1 %>%
  filter(cases == 0) %>%
  nrow()
```

So it appears that either a country has all its values in a year as non-missing if the WHO collected data for that country, or all its values are non-missing. 
So it is okay to treat explicitly and implicitly missing values the same, and we don't lose any information by dropping them.
```{r,include=FALSE}
gather(who, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases") %>%
  group_by(country, year)  %>%
  mutate(missing = is.na(cases)) %>%
  select(country, year, missing) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)
```



###2. What happens if you neglect the mutate() step? (mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))

`separate` emits the warning "too few values", and if we check the 
rows for keys beginning with `"newrel_"`, we see that `sexage` is messing, 
and `type = m014`.

```{r}
who3a <- who1 %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")

filter(who3a, new == "newrel") %>% head()
```


###3. I claimed that iso2 and iso3 were redundant with country. Confirm this claim.

```{r}
select(who3, country, iso2, iso3) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)
```


###4. For each country, year, and sex compute the total number of cases of TB. Make an informative visualization of the data.

```{r}
who5 %>%
  group_by(country, year, sex) %>%
  filter(year > 1995) %>%
  summarise(cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  unite(country_sex, country, sex, remove = FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases, group = country_sex, color='variable')) +
  geom_line()
```
